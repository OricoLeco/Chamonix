Images Of Chamonix: A Mini Project
 
The purpose of this exercise is simply to find out *how you approach projects* and *how you structure your code*.  The exercise tests your skills in backend and frontend skills as well).
 
We're not in any way trying to catch you out.  In fact, this should be a bit of fun! 
 
 
The Project
 
Weâ€™d like you to build, *from scratch*, a little application that displays photographs, fetched from the public Flickr API, of snowy Chamonix, the home of our French office.
 
The end result should look like the enclosed screenshot (which shows the app developed by our senior developer).
 
Bonus points will be awarded for showing initiative - by building things to support future enhancements, or by improving the user experience, for example.
 
When you're done, please push your work to a public repository on GitHub.  Then, send us a link via Davina.
 
 
 
 
The Application
 
In general, the application should comprise *at least* two parts:
 
- A PHP script that, when requested, transforms the data in Flickr's most-recent feed - URL provided below - into JSON and then emits it;
- An HTML5 document that requests the data from the PHP script using AJAX and then displays the photographs as shown in the screenshot.
 
 
 
The PHP
 
We'd like to see object-oriented PHP (5.0 - 5.4).  Please demonstrate your knowledge of design patterns, best practice, etc.
 
Do *not* use a framework or any third-party libraries.
 
Fetch image data from https://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?tags=chamonix,ski,snow
 
 
 
 
The HTML and JavaScript
 
In the HTML, we'd like to see semantic markup and evidence that you're aware of progressive enhancement.  The same applies to any HTML created by the JavaScript.
 
You *can* use jQuery, but do *not* use plugins.  Please demonstrate your knowledge of design patterns, best practice, etc.
 
The image captions, as seen in the screenshot, comprise the title of the photograph and the author's name.  The format is "[title] by [author]".
 
The image should link to the photograph's page on Flickr (e.g. https://www.flickr.com/photos/emanuelabonardi/16669033879/).
 
 
 
 
The CSS
 
CSS3 is mandatory, given the visual effects we're looking for.
 
Do *not* use any third-party frameworks, libraries, or whatever.
 
What you can't see from the screenshot are some transitions we'd like you to implement.
 
- On hover, the image should *smoothly* fade from an opacity of 0.8 - the default state - to an opacity of 1.
- On hover, a dark circle, containing a Font Awesome icon of your choice, should be displayed above the centre of the image.  Take a look at the second image at the top left of the screenshot.
